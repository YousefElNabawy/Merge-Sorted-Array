Explanation:
The code starts merging from the end of both arrays to prevent overwriting elements in nums1.
By the end, nums1 contains the merged array in non-decreasing order.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: 
𝑂(𝑚+𝑛), since each element in nums1 and nums2 is considered once.

Space Complexity: 
𝑂(1), since the merge is done in-place.
